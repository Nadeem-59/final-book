# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Basics

This chapter will delve into the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2, focusing on how different components of a robotic system communicate and operate. We will explore the core concepts of ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services, providing simple yet illustrative examples to solidify your understanding.

## Overview

In ROS 2, applications are built as a collection of modular nodes that communicate with each other. This distributed architecture allows for flexible and robust robot control.

-   **Nodes**: The executable processes that perform computation.
-   **Topics**: The mechanism for asynchronous, one-to-many communication between nodes.
-   **Services**: The mechanism for synchronous, request-response communication between nodes.

Through practical examples, you will learn how to:
-   Create and manage ROS 2 nodes.
-   Publish data to and subscribe to data from ROS 2 topics.
-   Implement and call ROS 2 services.
