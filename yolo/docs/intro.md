# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

An Interactive Textbook for Building the Next Generation of intelligent Robots.

[Start Reading](./module-1-foundations/)

This book teaches the fundamental principles of building intelligent robotic systems from scratch. We will explore how to integrate modern AI with physical hardware and simulation to create robots that can perceive, reason, and act in the real world.

This book is for developers, students, and researchers interested in AI, robotics, and simulation. A background in Python is recommended.

We will explore a full stack for Physical AI, including:
- ROS 2
- Python
- URDF
- Gazebo (for physics)
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim (for photorealism)
- Large Language Models (for cognitive tasks)
