# Chapter 2: Anatomy of a Humanoid

This chapter details the key components that make up a humanoid robot. We will explore the hardware and software that give these machines their ability to perceive, act, and think.

## The "Brain": Control Systems

At the heart of every humanoid robot is a complex control system, the "brain" of the machine. This system is responsible for processing information from the robot's sensors, making decisions, and sending commands to the actuators.

## Sensing the World:
- **LIDAR:** We'll explore how Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors are used to create 3D maps of the environment, enabling navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- **Cameras:** From simple cameras for basic vision to advanced stereo cameras for depth perception, we will look at how visual information is captured and processed.

## Making a Move: Actuators

Actuators are the muscles of a robot, responsible for generating movement. We will discuss the different types of actuators used in humanoid robots, from electric motors to hydraulic and pneumatic systems.
