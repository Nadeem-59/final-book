# Module 1: Foundations of Humanoid Robotics

This module introduces the core principles that make humanoid robots function. We will build conceptual foundations before moving into deeper engineering topics.

This module is for beginner to intermediate robotics students, hackathon participants, and early-stage builders entering humanoid robotics for the first time.

In this module, we will explain the "why" behind humanoid robotics, covering topics like:
- The history and evolution of humanoid robots
- The key components of a humanoid robot
- The challenges and opportunities in humanoid robotics
