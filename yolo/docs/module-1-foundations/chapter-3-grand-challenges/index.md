# Chapter 3: The Grand Challenges

This chapter discusses the primary obstacles that researchers and engineers face in the field of humanoid robotics. These are the grand challenges that must be overcome to create truly autonomous and capable humanoid robots.

## Stable Bipedal Locomotion

Walking on two legs is a complex task that humans perform with ease. For robots, however, it is a major challenge. We will explore the difficulties of maintaining balance and stability, especially on uneven terrain.

## Complex Manipulation

The human hand is a marvel of engineering, capable of a wide range of dexterous movements. Replicating this level of manipulation in a robotic hand is a significant challenge. We will discuss the complexities of grasping and manipulating objects of various shapes and sizes.

## Safe Human-Robot Interaction

As robots become more integrated into our daily lives, ensuring safe interaction with humans is paramount. This section will cover the challenges of designing robots that can work alongside people without causing harm.

## Multi-Modal Interaction

To be truly useful, robots need to be able to communicate with humans in a natural way. We will explore the challenges of integrating multiple modes of communication, such as speech, gesture, and vision, into a seamless and intuitive interface.
