# Lesson 1: Computer Vision for Humanoid Robotics

Computer vision is a critical component of humanoid robotics, enabling robots to perceive and understand the world around them. This lesson provides a high-level overview of how computer vision is used to identify obstacles and recognize objects.

## Obstacle Avoidance

One of the most basic and important applications of computer vision in robotics is obstacle avoidance. By using cameras and other sensors, a robot can build a 3D map of its environment and identify potential obstacles in its path. This allows the robot to navigate safely and avoid collisions.

## Object Recognition

Object recognition is the task of identifying and locating objects in an image or video. This is a more complex task than obstacle avoidance, but it is essential for many robotics applications. For example, a robot might need to recognize a specific tool to pick it up, or it might need to identify a person to interact with them.
