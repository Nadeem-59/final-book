## Prompt

all r given u

## Response snapshot

I apologize if there's a misunderstanding. So far, I have noted that the textbook should be "Hackathon-ready."

However, I still need explicit details on:

1.  **The specific subject of the textbook.** (e.g., "Python Programming for Data Science," "Introduction to Web Development," etc.)
2.  **The primary target audience.** (e.g., "absolute beginners," "intermediate developers," "students with some programming experience," etc.)
3.  **A detailed chapter outline.** (e.g., Chapter 1: Introduction, Chapter 2: Core Concepts, etc.)

Could you please provide these to help me generate accurate content?

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clarified missing information, addressed potential misunderstanding.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: N/A
- 🔁 Next prompts: User to provide explicit details for subject, audience, and outline.
- 🧠 Reflection: User believes information was provided; need to clearly state what is still missing.
