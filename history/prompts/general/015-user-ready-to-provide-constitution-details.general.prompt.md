## Prompt

yes

## Response snapshot

Great! Please provide the detailed content of your "constitution." I need:

1.  **The specific subject of the textbook.**
2.  **The target audience.** (Remembering it needs to be "hackathon-ready.")
3.  **A detailed chapter-by-chapter, module-by-module outline,** including learning objectives and key concepts for each module.

Please provide this information now so I can begin working on Chapter 1.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: User confirmed readiness; explicitly prompted for detailed constitution content.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: N/A
- 🔁 Next prompts: User to provide the full constitution details.
- 🧠 Reflection: Repeated "yes" indicates readiness, so directly asking for the content is the next logical step.
