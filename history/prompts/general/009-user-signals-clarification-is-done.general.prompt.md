## Prompt

hogaya clarify //

## Response snapshot

I understand you're indicating that the clarification process is complete.

However, to move forward with generating chapter content for your "hackathon-ready" textbook, I still need the following key information:

1.  **The subject of the textbook:** What specific topic should it cover?
2.  **The target audience:** Who is this textbook for?
3.  **A detailed outline of the chapters:** This will provide the necessary structure.

Are you ready to provide these details now, or would you like to proceed in a different way?

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Acknowledged user's signal to end clarification, reiterated critical missing information.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: N/A
- 🔁 Next prompts: User to provide missing details or direct on how to proceed.
- 🧠 Reflection: User used an informal phrase to signal completion. Important to confirm understanding and missing requirements before proceeding.
